# Game Screenshots and UI Design
Some screens have been developed (as a rough first draft) in engine (UNITY 6) to begin to lock down the look and feel of the game. Others have been designed in figma.

1. Start New game: 
Options like customizing their empire flag, choosing their civilization and customizing the civilization name. The generation seed is included here, so players can share seeds with friends to generate the same galaxy. 
 
2.	Zoomed in screenshot of a star system in game
 
3.	Galaxy map (Design)
 

4.	Solar System view (design)
 

5.	Planet Management (standalone & relative to rest of screen)
